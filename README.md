# Split_MechanicalKeyboard_usingESP32DevMod
My journey building a wireless split keyboard from scratch using ESP32 Dev Module. Includes custom firmware for matrix scanning and layer management.
## 📝 To-Do List
- [x] Protoyping the keyboard using breadboard n pushbutton
- [x] Connecting left-right side
- [x] Implement debouncing logic.
- [ ] Add battery level monitoring over BLE.
- [x] making the PCB file
- [ ] Design 3D printable case.

![Tampilan Prototipe](https://github.com/mug31/Split_MechanicalKeyboard_usingESP32DevMod/blob/main/images/1763949235553.jpeg)
*This is the prototype using breadboard-pushbutton, and it was using the matrix 4x5.*

## This is how the pcb looks like
i use KICAD to make this PCB, and for the footprint i use library from scotto keebs https://github.com/joe-scotto/scottokeebs/tree/main/Extras/ScottoKicad
