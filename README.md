# Split_MechanicalKeyboard_usingESP32DevMod
My journey building a wireless split keyboard from scratch using ESP32 Dev Module. Includes custom firmware for matrix scanning and layer management.
## 📝 To-Do List
- [x] Protoyping the keyboard using breadboard n pushbutton
- [x] Connecting left-right side
- [x] Implement debouncing logic.
- [ ] Add battery level monitoring over BLE.
- [ ] making the PCB file
- [ ] Design 3D printable case.
